<h1>An Interactive Explorer for TV Series Data (Embedding Explorer)</h1>

<p>
The following visualization presents a 2D representation, obtained through <b>PCA</b>, of various TV series.
This representation was created by aggregating 96-dimensional spaCy word embeddings, 
representing both titles and genres of over <b>100,000</b> TV series. An additional temporal (or <a href="https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/">positional</a>) 
embedding representing the starting years of each series was also added to the aggregated embedding to account for both textual and temporal contextualization. 
</p>
<p>
Each color denotes 1 of 7 clusters determined by application of 
Gaussian Mixture Models on the final embeddings. This generative algorithm assigns probabilities of membership to each cluster, 
also allowing for the entropy of each individual TV series to be computed. 
</p>
<p>
Interact with the widgets on the left to query a subset of TV series to visualize.
Hover over the circles to see more information about each series.
